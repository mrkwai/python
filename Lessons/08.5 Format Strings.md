# Python - Format - Strings

## String Format
As we learned in the Python Variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers like this:

```python
#This will return an error:
age = 36
txt = "My name is John, I am " + age
print(txt)
```

But we can combine strings and numbers by using the ```ormat()``` method!

The ```format()``` method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places them in the string where the placeholders ```{}``` are:

```python
age = 36
txt = "My name is John, and I am {}"
print(txt.format(age))
```

The format() method takes unlimited number of arguments, and are placed into the respective placeholders:
```python
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want {} pieces of item {} for {} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))
```

You can use index numbers ```{0}``` to be sure the arguments are placed in the correct placeholders:
```python
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want to pay {2} dollars for {0} pieces of item {1}."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))
```
