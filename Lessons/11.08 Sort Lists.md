# Python - Sort Lists

## Sort List Alphanumerically
List objects have a ```sort()``` method that will sort the list alphanumerically, ascending, by default:

```python
thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]
thislist.sort()
print(thislist)
```

```python
thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort()
print(thislist)
```

## Sort Descending
To sort descending, use the keyword argument ``reverse = True```:

```python
thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]
thislist.sort(reverse = True)
print(thislist)
```

```python
thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort(reverse = True)
print(thislist)
```

## Customize Sort Function
You can also customize your own function by using the keyword argument key = function.

The function will return a number that will be used to sort the list (the lowest number first):

```python
#Sort the list based on how close the number is to 50:

def myfunc(n):
  return abs(n - 50)

thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort(key = myfunc)
print(thislist)
```

## Case Insensitive Sort
By default the ```sort()``` method is case sensitive, resulting in all capital letters being sorted before lower case letters:

```python
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]
thislist.sort()
print(thislist)
```

Luckily we can use built-in functions as key functions when sorting a list.

So if you want a case-insensitive sort function, use str.lower as a key function:

```python
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]
thislist.sort(key = str.lower)
print(thislist)
```

## Reverse Order
What if you want to reverse the order of a list, regardless of the alphabet?

The ```reverse()``` method reverses the current sorting order of the elements.

```python
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]
thislist.reverse()
print(thislist)
```
