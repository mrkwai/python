# Python User Input

## User Input
Python allows for user input.

That means we are able to ask the user for input.

Python 3 uses the ```input()``` method.

The following example asks for the username, and when you entered the username, it gets printed on the screen:

```python
username = input("Enter username:")
print("Username is: " + username)
```
